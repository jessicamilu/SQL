### Hello, My name is Jess. This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written for fun. Feel free to connect with me via LinkedIn or via email @ milu.jessica@gmail.com

## I have a variety of different files available. Some are small projects where I have written the SQL for the database, and found ways to describe the data.
##if you want the more advanced SQL I have done, please visit the soonest file on date. 

# why I like data science. I've always had a knack for data, believeing that it is a very imperical way to make a conclusion. Working to find out the data behind a topic of interest of mine is rewarding. My favorite project of mine was working with the astronaut data. I looked at the data through the perspective of inequalities. This favorite is followed closely by the House Elves project which was so silly and fun.
